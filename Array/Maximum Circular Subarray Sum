//PROBLEM STATEMENT-

Given an array arr[] of N integers arranged in a circular fashion. Your task is to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {8,-8,9,-9,10,-11,12}
Output:
22
Explanation:
Starting from the last element
of the array, i.e, 12, and 
moving in a circular fashion, we 
have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, 
-9, 10, which gives maximum sum 
as 22.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {10,-3,-4,7,6,5,-4,-1}
Output:
23
Explanation: Sum of the circular 
subarray with maximum sum is 23

//OUTPUT-
